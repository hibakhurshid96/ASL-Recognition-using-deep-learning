# ASL-Recognition-using-deep-learning
American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabets Gesture Recognition: A Performance Comparison of CNN, Transfer Learning, and Vision Transformers

# Summary
- Combining 3 public datasets (Kaggle, Roboflow, MNIST)
- Preprocessing and converting images to grayscale
- Creating 3 versions of the dataset (28x28, 64x64, 224x224)
- Building and testing three deep learning models with fine tuning (CNN, Transfer Learning, Vision Transfer)
-Evaluating models using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices
- Creating a real-time ASL recognizer using a webcam.
